# Halloween TableView

It's halloween!  Time to make an app to showcase these frightening times.

Inside this repo, you'll find a skeleton project with a HalloweenImage class outlined.  

### Step 1:

Create and populate a tableView.  The main text should be the name of the image, and the subtitle text should be the tags joined together.

Example:

Main text: "witchForest"

Subtitle text: "Tags: Witch, Moon, Forest"

### Step 2:

Create a custom tableview cell that contains an image, and a label.  

### Step 3

The images should alternate from being

1. Alligned in the center, pinned to the top with the label below it
2. Alligned in the center, pinned to the bottom with the label below it


### Step 4

Divide the elements in ImageData into at least 3 categories using their tags.  There are several ways to make this division.  Then, create a title for each section for the tag they have in common.

### Step 5

Sort the categories by their titles

### Step 6

Add an image of a ghost that inserts itself randomly into your tableview.  The image of the ghost should change to a different image when you select it.
